# Say-and-Do

Voice controlled ToDo List.

Your basic ToDo List web appliccation with voice control that acctually saves you time.



* Activate the app by pressing 'start recording' and saying 'hey'. 
* Say your task as it appears in the text box. 
* Finish by saying 'bye'. 
* Next, by command 'add' add a new task or 'reset'/'clear' to start over.
* If you want to delete or edit an already exsisting task, just say 'delete task *Number of the task*' of 'edit task *Number of the task*'.
* The tasks are numerated top to bottom.
* Once you are finished with a task, mark it as done.
